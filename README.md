## 🌐 Network Fundamentals

This section of my TryHackMe learning journey explores the **core building blocks of computer networking** — how devices talk to each other, how data moves across networks, and how networks are structured and expanded.

Each topic has its own folder in this repo with clear, beginner-friendly notes and reflections based on hands-on practice from the rooms.

### 🧠 Overview

### 🌍 What is Networking?
- Learned the basics of networking, including how devices connect and communicate within different types of networks like LAN, WAN, and the internet.  
- Explored key concepts such as IP addressing, subnetting, and network protocols like TCP/IP that enable seamless data transfer and communication.

### 🏠 Intro to LAN
- Learned how devices communicate on a Local Area Network (LAN) using switches, MAC addresses, and ARP.
- Explored how data travels within a LAN and how devices identify each other without needing the Internet.

### 🧱 OSI Model  
- Learned how the 7 layers of the OSI Model work together to move data across networks.  
- Explored key concepts like encapsulation, IP vs MAC addressing, and protocols like TCP, UDP, and DNS.

### 📦 Packets and Frames  
- Learned how packets and frames work together to send data across a network.  
- Explored key concepts like TCP/UDP protocols, the three-way handshake, ports, and packet structure.

### 📡 Extending Your Network  
- Explored how routers, switches, VLANs, firewalls, and VPNs help expand and secure modern networks.  
- Practised configuring firewall rules and sending packets through a simulated network to understand real-world traffic flow.
