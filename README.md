# 🌐 Network Fundamentals

This section of my TryHackMe learning journey explores the **core building blocks of computer networking** — how devices talk to each other, how data moves across networks, and how networks are structured and expanded.

Each topic has its own folder in this repo with clear, beginner-friendly notes and reflections based on hands-on practice from the rooms.
